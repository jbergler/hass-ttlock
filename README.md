## Overview

This integration uses the TTLock Cloud to communicate with your lock. It supports the following features:

- Locking and unlocking
- Discovery of locks on startup
- Real-time updates via a webhook (no periodic polling which wastes battery)
- Additional sensors for battery, last operator + reason
- Add new pass codes
- Delete expired pass codes

# Usage

## Requirements

1. A TTLock based smart lock
1. A Gateway (if your lock doesn't have integrated wifi)
   - These can be purchased from the vendor of your lock or direct from [Aliexpress](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DEPpClx)

## Creating an OAuth APP

1. Go to https://open.ttlock.com/manager and create an account
1. Register an application (this will take a few days to get approved)
1. Install the extension [via HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=jbergler&repository=hass-ttlock&category=integration) and restart Home Assistant
1. Setup the integration [via Home Assistant UI](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=ttlock)
1. Once the integration is working you should receive a system notification with the webhook url
   - This will go away when the webhook receives data
1. Go back to the url from the first step and set the 'Callback URL' for your application
